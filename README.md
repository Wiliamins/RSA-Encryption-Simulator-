# RSA-Encryption-Simulator-
Created a command-line Python application simulating RSA asymmetric encryption. Developed logic for prime number generation, modular arithmetic, key pair creation, and secure message encryption/decryption using RSA principles. Focused on manual cryptographic implementation without external libraries.
