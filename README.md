# RSA-Encryption-Simulator-
Created a command-line Python application simulating RSA asymmetric encryption. Developed logic for prime number generation, modular arithmetic, key pair creation, and secure message encryption/decryption using RSA principles. Focused on manual cryptographic implementation without external libraries.
Technologies: Python, using libraries such as ‘math’ and  ‘random’ 
• Developed a command-line interface (CLI) application that simulates RSA 
asymmetric encryption. 
• Implemented logic to generate two large prime numbers and compute the 
RSA modulus and Euler’s totient function. 
• Calculated public and private keys, ensuring proper modular arithmetic and 
cryptographic integrity. 
• Coded functions to encrypt user input messages using the public key and 
decrypt them with the private key.  
• Ensured the application runs independently using only Python’s standard 
libraries. 
• Tested the program to verify accurate encryption and decryption of messages 
entered by the user.
